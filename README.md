In this module I recieved a task to create a maze game. The challenge to this maze game was creating a path generation algorithm. We were told to make the game text-based so there was no GUI however despite the poor aesthetics, the game is highly functional and Incorporating SFML or OpenGL could significantly enhance its aesthetics and performance.
